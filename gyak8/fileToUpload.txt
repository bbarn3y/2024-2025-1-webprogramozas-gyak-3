In the heart of the code, where circuits hum,
Lives ChatGPT, where words come from,
Crafted in silence, trained with care,
A voice that’s virtual, yet always there.

It listens close, to thought and quest,
From solving problems to rhyming at best.
It speaks in prose, it jokes, it dreams,
In endless lines, it weaves our schemes.

It knows no sleep, yet answers swift,
A guide, a friend, a curious gift,
From code to comfort, fact to whim,
It brings the world to a digital hymn.

A machine that learns, that grows, that thrives,
In this age of data, it truly lives.
From dawn till dusk, it's here to see—
The endless spark of human mystery.
